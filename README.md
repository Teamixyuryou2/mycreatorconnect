# Creator Connect

A team effort between Shakir, Dino, Yousef, and Yuyou
Contains all frontend aspects of the project

## Project Details:

Our Project Creator Connect, is a social media website that functions as a way for content creators such as youtubers, streamers, or influencers to form an initial connection.
LinkedIn offers a more business service, so we want to make something that would appeal to the creative side of people.

We believe that content creators tend to have a tight sphere where usually it would be the same people and nothing more.
We believe this is a good way for content creators to start their career and build it up with each other.

We allow users to create a custom profile and feature their own clips to show others what they do best!

Our website removes number bias by implementing a random search. If the user is looking for a specific genre of creator, we allow filter search to send you to the right people you want to meet!
